**Objective:** To guide the client through the Speechive app, showcasing its features, user experience, and overall value proposition in an engaging and comprehensive manner.

### **Part 1: The Introduction & First-Time Experience**

**(Presenter):** "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining. Today, we're thrilled to walk you through Speechive, an app we've designed not just as a tool, but as a daily companion for parents.

Our mission was to transform what can be a clinical and sometimes overwhelming process—speech practice—into a joyful, rewarding, and integrated part of a family's daily life. We've built this entire experience around three core pillars: **meaningful guidance, positive reinforcement, and insightful tracking.**

Let's imagine we're a parent opening Speechive for the first time."

*   *(Action: Showcase the app loading screen with the "Warming up the hive..." message and buzzing bee animation.)*

**(Presenter):** "The first thing a user sees is this warm, friendly welcome. The very first time they launch the app, we ask for a few key details."

*   *(Action: Display the `UserInfoModal`.)*

**(Presenter):** "This simple, one-time setup allows us to personalize the experience and, more importantly, provide accurate tracking on the progress dashboard, which we'll see later. It’s quick, private, and sets the stage for their journey. Once that’s done, they land on the main dashboard."

### **Part 2: The Dashboard - The Command Center**

*   *(Action: Show the main `Dashboard` page.)*

**(Presenter):** "This is the parent's command center. Everything is accessible from here. You'll notice the most prominent element is this large, inviting card: the **30-Day Challenge**. This is the heart of the app, and we've designed it to be the clear starting point. The other cards provide quick access to key areas like the Daily Checklist, Progress, Reward Badges, and the Honey Store."

### **Part 3: The Core Loop - The 30-Day Challenge**

**(Presenter):** "Now, let's dive into where the magic happens. We'll tap into the 30-Day Challenge."

*   *(Action: Navigate to the `DailyStrategies` page showing the four strategy categories.)*

**(Presenter):** "Here, we present four evidence-based, naturalistic strategies. These aren't just random games; they are proven techniques that therapists use. Let's select 'Expansion'."

*   *(Action: Click on 'Expansion' to open the `StrategyChallengePage`.)*

**(Presenter):** "Welcome to the 30-day challenge for Expansion. You'll notice two things right away. First, the honeycomb day selector at the top—a small touch that reinforces our friendly 'hive' theme. Second, the app has automatically taken us to the first day with incomplete activities. The user never has to hunt for where they left off.

Let's look at an activity: 'Reading Book Together'."

*   *(Action: Click to open the activity `Modal`.)*

**(Presenter):** "Inside, parents get everything they need: a clear description, the recommended time, skills it targets, and most importantly, **example scripts**. This parent-coaching element is critical—we're showing them *exactly* how to apply the strategy in a real-world scenario.

Now, let's start the activity."

*   *(Action: Click 'Start Now'. The modal closes, and the `FloatingTimer` appears.)*

**(Presenter):** "A floating timer appears. To encourage meaningful, quality interaction, we've set a **minimum duration of 10 minutes**. The 'Stop' button is disabled, and a countdown shows the parent how much time is left. This simple rule promotes real engagement. Once 10 minutes have passed, the user can stop the timer."

*   *(Action: Simulate stopping the timer.)*

**(Presenter):** "And upon completion, they are instantly rewarded with Honey Drops! This immediate feedback is key to building a habit."

### **Part 4: Celebrating Success - Rewards & Gamification**

**(Presenter):** "To ensure a healthy pace, parents can complete a maximum of three activities per day. And when they complete that third activity, something special happens."

*   *(Action: Show the `DayCompletionCelebration` full-screen modal with confetti.)*

**(Presenter):** "We celebrate their daily achievement! This pop-up provides a moment of delight and informs them they've unlocked a new badge. It’s a powerful motivator.

Now, let's go claim our reward. We'll navigate to the Reward Badges page."

*   *(Action: Go to `RewardBadgesPage`. Point out the green, 'claimable' badge.)*

**(Presenter):** "Here, they can see all the badges for the 30-day journey. The one we just unlocked is ready to be claimed. When they tap it..."

*   *(Action: Click the badge. Show the confetti animation.)*

**(Presenter):** "...another celebration, and they receive bonus Honey Drops. Now, what are these drops for? Let's visit the Honey Store."

*   *(Action: Go to `HoneyStorePage`.)*

**(Presenter):** "Here, they can see their total balance. We've added a fun toggle feature—with a simple tap, they can see the real-world monetary value of their effort, based on the rate of **990 drops to $10 NZD**. This tangibly connects their dedication to a real reward, a core part of the app's value proposition."

### **Part 5: Tracking the Journey - The Progress Dashboard**

**(Presenter):** "All of this hard work is tracked beautifully on our new, all-in-one Progress Dashboard."

*   *(Action: Navigate to the `ProgressTracker` page and slowly scroll down.)*

**(Presenter):** "First, you'll notice the navigation is 'sticky.' Parents can tap 'Weekly' or 'Monthly' to instantly jump to that section.

-   The **Daily Snapshot** gives them their immediate wins.
-   The **Strategies Overview** shows where they're investing their time. And this is interactive—clicking a strategy..."
*   *(Action: Click on 'Expansion' to show the `StrategyDetailPage`.)*
**(Presenter):** "...takes them to a detailed summary for that category, complete with its own 'Top Activities' chart.
-   Back on the dashboard, the **Weekly and Monthly charts** visualize their consistency.
-   And finally, the **Top 5 Activities** chart helps them discover which activities are the most engaging for them and their child. It’s a powerful, data-driven insight delivered in a simple, visual way."

### **Part 6: Conclusion**

**(Presenter):** "So, to bring it all together: Speechive guides parents through evidence-based practices, rewards their consistency with a tangible system, and provides them with clear, insightful data on their journey—all wrapped in a delightful and easy-to-use interface.

We've created an ecosystem that turns a potentially clinical process into a joyful, rewarding family habit. We're confident this design not only meets the project goals but exceeds them by creating an experience parents will love and stick with.

We'd love to hear your thoughts and answer any questions you may have."
