Overview:
Speechive is a creative and engaging mobile app designed for parents and caregivers to support their children with hearing loss or speech delays. Inspired by the hive-and-honey theme, Speechive focuses on daily routines, interactive strategies, and progress tracking — all wrapped in a clean, animated, and user-friendly interface.
